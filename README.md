# MovieMood

MovieMood let's you upload a selfie and will recommend a movie based on your mood!

This app is an exercise in connecting front-end APIs, in this case,
the [Microsoft Face API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/) and the [MovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

* Fuad Guluzade - Concept, MovieDB Integration, Front-End View
* Weston Carpenter - Concept, Face-API Integration, Mood/Genre Relationship Logic
* Pengwei Tian - Concept, User-Interaction Design, HTML/CSS
* Cooper Brislain - Scrum Master, Code-Wrangler, Git Getter
